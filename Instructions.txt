The solution has 2 projects:
1. TestCode. 
   This project contains a class called StatsCalculator that has 2 methods that must be implemented.
   The SampleData class has test data so you can see the data structure you must use in order to complete the assignment.
     If you want to pass the sample data into StatsCalculator: var statsCalc = new StatsCalculator(SampleData.Teams);
2. TestCodeTests
   This is a empty project. 
   You are free to add any test and/or mocking framework in order to test the methods you must implemented in StatsCalculator.
   Note we have added a commented out method just to show a very simple test. It is just for illustrative purposes.
   
   
What must be completed:
  Inside StatsCalculator.cs are 2 methods with ToDos that must be implemented. These are PlayerByPlayerNumber and TeamWinPercentage
  Read the ToDo's in order to understand what each method must do.

  You must implement these 2 methods. Please implemented any tests (in the test project) you feel are relevant. 

Note that we have supplied a sample stub for IStatsWeighting in the test project.
We are not concerned about the implementation of the Apply method in this interface (return 1 for the sake of this test and a exception if the player has done less than 100 races) but rather verifying it is called under the correct circumstances.
